# realpolitik

An attempt at a Java-based political sim.

Planned features/things to be done:
 * Political parties - Join or switch parties, but don't get in their bad graces.
 * Special interest groups - Depending on your positions, you may recieve support or be lobbied by groups like the NRA, EFF, big banks, unions, civil rights activists and more.
 * Voter groups - Whether you pander to the working class, the economic elites, the young, the old, the atheistic, or the deeply religious, you'll need to accumulate a wealth of votes to win.
 * Media - From the moment you enter the public eye, you'll surely come under fire for whatever you do. From mainstream sources to fringe coverage, not all publicity is good publicity.
 * Super PACs - Money is everything in American politics, you'll need Super PACs if you want a chance of winning.
